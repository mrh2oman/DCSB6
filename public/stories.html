        <p>Early Childhood Mental Health Specialists at Positive Bright Start embraced Emmanuel* and his mom through a collaborative relationship with the Willow Domestic Violence Center while his mother was seeking support and assistance following an abusive
            relationship. The family was referred to a Therapists at Positive Bright Start by the Bert Nash Parent Support Specialist who works closely with the staff at the Willow. Opportunities to access quality early care and education, mental health
            services, and case management were in place. Emmanuel’s Mom received a diagnosis of PTSD and several other diagnoses as well as a degenerative disease the needs for which disability assistance has been designed to address.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Emmanuel was enrolled at the Positive Bright Start Model Classroom and received individual therapy from a Therapist. The classroom is in a public housing unit donated by the Lawrence-Douglas County Housing Authority. This classroom is monitored
            and evaluated to continuously improve the quality of the relationships between teachers and children. Classroom quality scores show high quality emotional supports, classroom organization and instructional support. Emmanuel also received a
            developmental screening and social-emotional screening as well as assessment to determine his social and emotional health based on five measures – initiative, self-regulation, attachment/relationships, total protective factors, and behavioral
            concerns. This assessment revealed a need for improvement in self-regulation. Because of the family situation – the family remained homeless – his family also needed child care financial aid, so that he has access to quality care and education
            that focused on his social and emotional development and well-being while his family remained in crisis. This family received SB6 support in the form of gas voucher, so that the child could continue to get to preschool and other family members

        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Success Story Two</h3>
        <p>Centro Hispano’s Therapist welcomed Jennifer Garcia* after she learned she was pregnant with her first child at the age of seventeen. The challenge of ensuring that our community guarantees that Jennifer and her child can pursue opportunities
            requires that we all come together. Jennifer faced barriers such as exposure to the threat of violence and experiencing multiple symptoms of depression. Real opportunities remained just beyond her grasp.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Shortly after confirming her pregnancy, Jennifer’s therapist assisted her in connecting with Strengthening Families Network partner, Healthy Families. The Healthy Families Home Visitor assisted her in receiving prenatal care. Her therapist went
            with her to a support group for moms at the local hospital. She began attending a Healthy Families group for teen moms at the Lawrence-Douglas County Health Department. Additionally, she was assisted in acquiring a Protection from Abuse Order
            against the father of her child by a Centro Hispano Bilingual Case Manager. His threats constant messaging and calling had taken a toll on her mental health and she was reporting difficulty sleeping and eating. Jennifer continued weekly therapy
            sessions and began working twice a week with a Centro Hispano case manager. Her case manager was also Latina and had also had her first child at the age of 17.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Jennifer reports that she was helped to connect to opportunities because she was working with someone who had shared her experience. Jennifer states, “I just really like working with Erica [Centro Hispano Case Manager]. She gets me and she knows
            what I am going through. I want to finish school so that can be a social worker like her. If she can do it, so can I.” Shortly after this, Jennifer began the Diploma Completion Program. She finished in February of 2015, just five weeks shy
            of giving birth to her son. Jennifer’s case manager was present at the hospital shortly after she gave birth. She assisted Jennifer in adding her newborn son to the PFA against her former boyfriend. Jennifer continued receiving services from
            Centro Hispano. She and her case manager have worked together to start social and emotional support group for new moms. She made plans to attend JCCC in the fall.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Success Story Three</h3>
        <p>Douglas County also works together to ensure that children with special needs grow to fully participate in our community. The SB6 Early Childhood Special Education Consultant worked with a family with three children, an infant daughter, a two
            year old son, and a three year old daughter. The two year old has a fairly recent diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The little boy receives speech and language therapy from tiny-k Early Intervention of Douglas County.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Early Childhood Special Education Consultant home visits to practice Floortime Strategies, an evidence-based therapy for children on the Autism Spectrum that helps increase their social-emotional and social communication skills. She partners
            with the child’s Speech and Language Pathologist so that parents, consultant and speech therapist are all consistent in our use of speech and language strategies so that he has multiple opportunities to use these strategies throughout his
            day. Recently the 3 ½ year old daughter has started exhibiting some increased tantrum behavior as well as some regression with toilet training. Her parents and the Consultant both feel that this is typical behavior, considering that her brother
            has special needs and the introduction to the family of her infant sister, but she and her parents worked with the Positive Bright Start Early Childhood Mental Health Specialist in order to help her parents decrease this behavior and give
            them the strategies they need to meet her needs. The son also received Applied Behavior Analysis therapy from the University of Kansas. Even though they were lucky enough to have their private insurance pay for a good part of this particular
            therapy, their weekly co-pay was still more than they could afford so they had to take on extra work, and do special fundraisers to support the funding for this therapy. The Consultant worked in partnership with his tiny-k provider, as well
            as his sister’s clinician so that they could provide wrap around service and be a team supporting this family.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The little boy with autism made excellent progress and made significant gains in the short time that the team has been working with him. The family made it clear that they are very grateful that SB6 Partners work as a team, and that they felt
            the team was a huge support to them, as well as their son. The Consultant also was able to help them access other resources in the community, such as support groups for families of children with autism. They stretched their budget very thin
            in order to provide the best care they can for their son and would not be able to access services if it required any more of an out-of- pocket expense for them. Although it is impossible to predict the future or the potential of any child,
            we know through numerous amount of research that such services provided at an early age drastically improve the outcomes for vulnerable children in our community.</p>
